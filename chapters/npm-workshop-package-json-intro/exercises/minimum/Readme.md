# package.json MVP

Every Node.js package is described by a package.json file. The package.json format is based on the CommonJS packages specification.

## Task

Create a package.json for a package called "mypackage", in the current directory with ONLY THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FIELDS.

Pick sensible defaults for all fields other than "name", as they will only be tested for existence.

### Hint

* `npm help json`
