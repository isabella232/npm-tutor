# package uninstallation

`npm uninstall <package-name>` will remove a package from the
`node_modules` directory.

## Task

Use a single npm command to remove the dependency located in the
`./uninstall` directory.

Run `npm-tutor verify` to proceed.

## Hints

* `npm uninstall` also works with the `--save` and `--save-dev` flags.
