# package uninstallation

`npm uninstall <package-name>` will remove a package from the
`node_modules` directory.

## Task

Purge the package from both the package.json and the `node_modules`
directory found in the `./uninstall` directory with a single npm
command.

Run `verify` to proceed.

## Hints

* `npm uninstall` also works with the `--save` and `--save-dev` flags.
