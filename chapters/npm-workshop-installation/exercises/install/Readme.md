# Installing dependencies

Use `npm install` to install the `duplexer2` module into the directory you
started this workshop in.

Once you have done this, run `npm-tutor verify` to proceed!

## Tips

* Local install (default): puts stuff in ./node_modules of the current package root.
* Global install (with -g): puts stuff in /usr/local or wherever node is installed.
* Install it locally if you're going to `require()` it.
* Install it globally if you're going to run it on the command line.
* If you need both, then install it in both places, or use `npm link`.
* The above tips are courtesy of `npm help folders`
* You can not configure the name of `node_modules`.
* See `npm faq` for more information on such design decisions.
