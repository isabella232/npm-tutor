# npm init - defaults

* "name" defaults to current folder name
* "license" defaults to ISC
* Populates repo/homepage info based on your git remote info
* Adds any existing packages found in node_modules/ to "dependencies"
* Lists folders in current directory in "directories"
* Adds packages found in node_modules to dependencies ONLY if there is no "dependencies" key. Easy to have development dependencies accidentally added "dependencies" so make sure to check

## Task

Create `test`, `examples`, `docs` and `lib` folders in the current directory.
