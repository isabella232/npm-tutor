# npm ls

From the `./npmls` directory:

* Run `npm install --silent`

Which version of `string_decoder` is installed within `through2`?

```
verify <x.y.z>
```

## Hint

* npm help ls
* If you can't find the `npmls` directory, go back to the directory in 
which you installed the workshopper (use `pwd` to find out where you are now)
