# npm info

Looks like there's lots of modules on npm to do the same task, how do
you know if a module is any good?

There's no hard and fast metric, you'll need to judge them based on a
variety of factors.

## Task

From the following modules, find the one with the most releases:

* optimist
* commander
* minimist

`npm-tutor verify <package-with-most-releases> <how-many>

## Hint

* `npm help info`
* You don't need to count the releases by hand, piping output into `wc -l` will count lines for you.
